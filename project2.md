## Project description
This team project was required in fulfillment of CSCI 495.  It involved designing a website allowing a user to create an account to sign up for horse back riding lessons.  It involved the teamwork of four people.  These people included Vijay Perumal, Ethan Powell, Lindsay Freshour, and Steven Yeung.  


## How to compil es / run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd project2
g++ -o html-test -g -I src/ src/html-parser.cpp src/main.cpp
```

## UI Design

This project is not an User Interface Project.  It mainly ran on a terminal in linux, therefore, the UI design of this project is quite simple.  When the program is ran, it will display if the HTML page(s) are balanced or not.  It will also display how many pages the HTML page can visit. The balance function uses vector of strings and integers in order to determine if the HTML pages are balanced or not. The parse function uses a vector of strings to parse and read through the HTML page.  Finally, the pages visiting function is a recursive function that uses a vector of strings and integers to determine if a HTML page is able to visit to any other pages or not.
